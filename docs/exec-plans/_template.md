# {{PLAN_TITLE}}

## Purpose / Big Picture

TODO: explain what becomes observably possible and how a person or agent can confirm it.

## Progress

- [ ] Establish current behavior and constraints.
- [ ] Deliver the smallest working milestone.
- [ ] Integrate and independently verify the candidate.
- [ ] Resolve documentation impact and follow-ups.

## Context and Orientation

TODO: explain relevant repository paths, modules, terms, current behavior, and authoritative documents for a reader with no chat history.

## Scope

- TODO

## Non-goals

- TODO

## Product Trace

Set `traceability: 1` and `product_spec` only when this plan must carry product-to-evidence traceability.

| Product spec | Journey | P0 requirement | Acceptance criteria | Implementation tasks | Verification tasks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | AC-1 | T2 | T3 |

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-1:** TODO

## Milestones

### M1 — Smallest observable slice

TODO: state the working behavior, implementation outline, and verification. Later milestones build on a repository that already works.

## Task Packets

### T1 — Explore and establish the change boundary

#### State

ready

#### Task type

support

#### Depends on

none

#### Execution constraints

- Required capabilities: TODO
- Tool access: TODO
- Concurrency: TODO
- Retry budget: TODO
- Time budget: TODO

#### Outcome

TODO

#### Non-goals

TODO

#### Read

TODO: exact documents and paths.

#### Allowed writes

Plan result only; no implementation writes unless Main expands this packet.

#### Protected paths

Everything not explicitly allowed.

#### Acceptance

AC-1

#### Verify

`./dev/context --plan {{PLAN_ID}}` and task-specific read-only checks.

#### Stop conditions

Conflicting sources, public-contract or data-migration impact, missing authority, or scope expansion.

#### Result

TODO: status; exact target commit SHA; changed paths or read-only scope; execution environment; commands run; verification scope; results and evidence; blockers, unresolved issues, and residual limitations; verifier recommendation when applicable; Main or human approval recorded separately.

### T2 — Implement the smallest working slice

#### State

blocked

#### Task type

implementation

#### Depends on

T1

#### Execution constraints

- Required capabilities: TODO
- Tool access: TODO
- Concurrency: TODO
- Retry budget: TODO
- Time budget: TODO

#### Outcome

TODO

#### Non-goals

TODO

#### Read

TODO

#### Allowed writes

TODO

#### Protected paths

All paths outside Allowed writes.

#### Acceptance

AC-1

#### Verify

`./dev/check` and task-specific tests.

#### Stop conditions

Allowed writes are insufficient, acceptance must change, a protected contract changes, or the same approach fails twice.

#### Result

TODO: status; exact target commit SHA; changed paths or read-only scope; execution environment; commands run; verification scope; results and evidence; blockers, unresolved issues, and residual limitations; verifier recommendation when applicable; Main or human approval recorded separately.

### T3 — Independently verify the integrated candidate

#### State

blocked

#### Task type

verification

#### Depends on

T2

#### Execution constraints

- Required capabilities: TODO
- Tool access: TODO
- Concurrency: TODO
- Retry budget: TODO
- Time budget: TODO

#### Outcome

Judge the exact integrated candidate in an independent context against observable acceptance without relying on implementer explanation. If the host cannot provide that context, report verification as not performed.

#### Non-goals

Redesign or unrelated cleanup.

#### Read

This plan, changed code, tests, and current-state documents.

#### Allowed writes

Verifier evidence only unless Main assigns a repair.

#### Protected paths

Implementation and acceptance criteria.

#### Acceptance

All criteria in this plan.

#### Verify

`./dev/verify` plus declared smoke or reproduction commands.

Verifier는 반례·실패 경로·회귀를 능동적으로 찾고 테스트 자체의 가정도 의심한다. 수정 후에는 새 exact candidate를 재검증한다.

#### Stop conditions

The candidate commit differs from the integrated target, evidence is unavailable, or requirements conflict.

#### Result

TODO: status; exact target commit SHA; changed paths or read-only scope; execution environment; commands run; verification scope; results and evidence; blockers, unresolved issues, and residual limitations; verifier recommendation; Main or human approval recorded separately. If an independent context was unavailable, state that independent verification was not performed.

결함에는 위반한 요구사항·trigger·영향과 재현 또는 구체적인 코드 근거를 제시한다. 우려·취향·미검증 영역은 결함과 구분하고 결함 개수를 강제하지 않는다.

## Architecture Impact

TODO: affected modules, dependency edges, invariants, and required machine checks; write `none` with a reason when there is no impact.

## Documentation Impact

| Document | Action | Reason | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/PRODUCT.md` | TODO: none/create/update/supersede/retire/generate | TODO | Main | pending |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | TODO | TODO | Main | pending |

## Interfaces and Dependencies

Main은 Task 간 공유 인터페이스·경로 소유권·의존성·통합 순서를 설계한다. 지정된 Lead는 상위 계약 안의 leaf 분해·경계 설계를 담당한다. TODO: 필요한 경계와 소유자·의존성·통합 순서를 적는다.

공유 계약은 병렬 수행 동안 고정한다. 변경이 필요하면 영향 작업을 멈추고 경계 소유자(Main: Task 간, Lead: parent 내부)가 계약을 조정한 뒤 재배정한다. parent 범위·계약·권한 변경은 Main에게 반환한다. 이 절차는 host/project의 더 제한적인 병렬 정책을 완화하지 않으며, 독립 경계를 만들 수 없으면 순차 수행한다.

- Existing project capability inspected: TODO
- New production dependency: none / TODO
- Public or cross-repository contract impact: none / TODO

## Migration, Rollout, and Recovery

TODO: record data migration, compatibility, rollout, rollback, retry, idempotency, and cleanup requirements; write `not applicable` with a reason where appropriate.

## Surprises and Discoveries

- {{DATE}} — Plan created; no discoveries recorded yet.

## Decision Log

- {{DATE}} — Initial scope proposed by Main; approval pending.

## Concrete Steps

Run commands from the repository root. Keep this section current and copy only durable summaries into Validation and Evidence.

1. `./dev/context --plan {{PLAN_ID}}`
2. TODO
3. `./dev/check`
4. `./dev/verify`

## Validation and Evidence

### Acceptance closure

| Acceptance criterion | Task | Evidence path | Run ID | Manifest SHA-256 | Verified commit | Gate verdict | Review reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | T2/T3 | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending | pending |

- Integrated target: pending
- Verified commit: pending
- Acceptance results: pending
- Commands and durable summaries: pending
- Raw logs: `.harness/runs/` and not committed

## Outcomes and Retrospective

TODO: summarize delivered behavior, remaining limits, and what should become a reusable rule, test, tool, or document.

## Follow-ups

Promote unresolved items to [`tech-debt-tracker.md`](/docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md) or the declared external backlog before completion.
